This is a Chrome extension project. The extension injects a Socratic AI chatbot into LeetCode problem pages, reads the problem title and description from the DOM, and interacts with the Gemini API to provide step-by-step, non-solution guidance. It includes adjustable guidance levels and a settings page for the Gemini API key and preferences.
